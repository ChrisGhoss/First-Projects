# 🎄 [Ornament Calculator](/christmas-ornament-estimator/ornament_calculator.py)
is my first-ever project, inspired by a quick glance at the Christmas tree at my home in January.
It got me wondering if there was a way to estimate how many ornaments were necessary for a Christmas tree using simply the tree's measurements, while of course depending on how much a person can spend.

With some decent research (and math), I managed to find the perfect program for anyone to solve this problem in under a minute.

## 💻 Code and Logic

The code contains some basic concepts of Python, meaning anyone can comprehend it with some analysis.
It asks for measurements, as well as whether you're on a budget or not to get the most accurate number of ornaments.
